# Racroz Engine

My very own Game Engine, most of it W.I.P. It is more than anything a PBR 3D model viewer with a working scene graph and UI.

Release Build: https://www.dropbox.com/s/dw4q1unje5xb1yk/RacrozEngineRelease.rar?dl=0

Layered as:

Utilities
-Core
--Engine
--GraphicsAPI (DX11)
---Renderer
---Editor
----Application

It has a fully working PBR rendering system with passes, materials and nvidia's VXGI for Global illumination.

I've been working on it sporadically for 4-5 years starting when i was still doing my degree 
so it will not be completely representative of my current programming skills until i perform a full rewrite of from the ground up.

I decided to make it public to keep it portfolio as in case someone stumbles upon it. I couldn't find any VXGI tutorials other from nvidia's provided samples 
and this could help some to implement it in their own engine.

I'll probably clean and finish some things that are incomplete to repackage this as a 3D PBR DX11 model viewer with global illumination in the future.

In the meantime here are some examples of what it can do on the famous Sponza and San Miguel.
